# User Departments - Reactive app

Minimal Spring Boot based reactive CRUD example, which manages user entity (including Swagger UI).

## Technology stack

java 21, Spring Boot, Webflux, Postgres, Flyway, Springfox

## Prerequisites

The following items should be installed in your system:

* java 21 or newer.
* git command line tool (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
* Your preferred IDE (IDEA preferably)

## Database configuration

Application uses a Postgres as a persistent storage. Options to get it up:

1. Use remote existing postgres. It is needed to specify the path in configs.
1. Start local postgres in docker `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`

### Running locally

This application is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built
using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/). You can build a jar file and run it from the command line:

```
git clone https://github.com/uJarOrg/sample-webflux-crud-secured.git
cd sample-webflux-crud-secured
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar
```

You might also want to use Maven's `spring-boot:run` goal - applications run in an exploded form, as they do in your IDE:

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local -P dev
```

Now you can access to the Swagger UI here: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

### Working with Application in your IDE

1) On the command line

```
git clone https://github.com/uJarOrg/sample-webflux-crud-secured.git
```

2) Inside IDE

In the main menu, choose `File -> Open` and select the Application [pom.xml](pom.xml). Click on the `Open` button.
Activate "local" profile in the Run settings or set it via environment
variables. [instruction](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38520638/how-to-set-spring-profile-from-system-variable)
Wait to indexing completion and push the green "play" button.

3) Navigate to Swagger UI

Visit [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) in your browser.

## Code conventions

### Tests

This project has standard JUnit tests. To run them execute this command:

```text
./mvnw verify -P testcontainers-support
```

## Versioning

Project uses a three-segment [CalVer](https://calver.org/) scheme, with a short year in the major version slot, short month in the minor version slot, and micro/patch version in the third
and final slot.

```
YY.MM.MICRO
```

1. **YY** - short year - 6, 16, 106
1. **MM** - short month - 1, 2 ... 11, 12
1. **MICRO** -  "patch" segment
